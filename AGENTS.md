# Agents Instructions

This repository is structured with **two main agents** (frontend & backend).  
Each agent has its own set of responsibilities, standards, and rules.  

- [Frontend Agent](./frontend_agent.md)  
- [Backend Agent](./backend_agent.md)  

## General Guidelines
- Always read the **PRD** (`PRD.md`) before starting tasks.
- Keep code **clean, modular, and short** (files â‰¤150 lines, target 100).
- Follow **type safety, testing, and security best practices**.
- Document architectural decisions in `README.md`.
- Ensure **dark mode UI** and **Supabase Auth** are implemented from the start.
- When in doubt: prefer to ask for **clarity over cleverness**.
