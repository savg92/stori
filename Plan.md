## Technical Standards & Quality Gates

### Code Quality Requirements

- **File Size Limit**: ≤150 lines per file (target 100)
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all frontend code
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for user flows
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier (frontend), Black (backend)
- **Documentation**: FastAPI auto-docs, inline comments for complex logic

### Performance Standards

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Min width 320px, tested on common devices
- **API Response Time**: <500ms for data queries, <2s for AI responses
- **Chart Rendering**: Smooth interactions on mobile devices
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT implementation with proper expiration

### Architecture Compliance

- **Backend**: Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- **Frontend**: Component → Hook → Utility separation
- **Database**: Supabase RLS policies enforced
- **AI**: LangChain pipeline with proper context management

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Items

1. **AI Integration Complexity**: Start with simple prompts, iterate
2. **Mobile Chart Performance**: Use Recharts optimizations, lazy loading
3. **Authentication Security**: Follow Supabase best practices strictly
4. **AWS Deployment Issues**: Prepare Docker containers, test locally first

### Contingency Plans

- **AI Fallback**: Pre-defined financial tips if OpenAI API fails
- **Chart Fallback**: Table view if Recharts has issues
- **Deployment Backup**: Local Docker deployment as demonstration alternative
