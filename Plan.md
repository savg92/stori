- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for user flows
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier (frontend), Black (backend)
- **Documentation**: FastAPI auto-docs, inline comments for complex logic

### Performance Standards

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Min width 320px, tested on common devices
- **API Response Time**: <500ms for data queries, <2s for AI responses
- **Chart Rendering**: Smooth interactions on mobile devices
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT implementation with proper expiration

### Architecture Compliance

- **Backend**: Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- **Frontend**: Component → Hook → Utility separation
- **Database**: Supabase RLS policies enforced
- **AI**: LangChain pipeline with proper context management

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Items

1. **AI Integration Complexity**: Start with simple prompts, iterate
2. **Mobile Chart Performance**: Use Recharts optimizations, lazy loading
3. **Authentication Security**: Follow Supabase best practices strictly
4. **AWS Deployment Issues**: Prepare Docker containers, test locally first

### Contingency Plans

- **AI Fallback**: Pre-defined financial tips if OpenAI API fails
- **Chart Fallback**: Table view if Recharts has issues
- **Deployment Backup**: Local Docker deployment as demonstration alternative

## Daily Standups & Reviews

### Daily Check-ins

- **Morning**: Review previous day's progress, address blockers
- **Midday**: Technical architecture review, code quality check
- **Evening**: Demo completed features, plan next day priorities

### Code Review Process

- **Agent Responsibilities**: Each agent reviews their domain code
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Both agents review integration points
- **Documentation**: Update README.md with architectural decisions

This plan ensures systematic development with quality gates at each phase, targeting a production-ready expense tracker with AI capabilities within the 4-day timeline.
